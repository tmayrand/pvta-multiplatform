The app is a hybrid that uses Ionic 2+.

All data is live, and comes from endpoints documented [here][swagger].

To begin developing, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
-   [Node.js <b>6+ and NPM 3+</b>](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   Ionic and Cordova CLIs: `npm install -g cordova@^7.0.1 ionic@^3.7.0`

    Note the explicit versions. Using versions other than the ones specified can
    cause local problems and Travis failures.
-   To develop and test on Android, you need the prerequisites for the
    [Cordova Android platform][cordova-android] installed. You must also
    [create an Android Virtual Device][avd].
-   To develop and test on iOS, you need the prerequisites for the
    [Cordova iOS platform][cordova-ios] installed.

## Setup

1.  Clone repository, cd into it.
2.  Run `npm install`

## Developing

The app's source code is in the `src` directory, and consists of Typescript,
HTML, and SCSS. Start editing away!

-   Viewing the results of your changes is easy:

    Just run `ionic serve -c` from the root  directory. Ionic will open your 
    default browser and navigate to itself for you.

-   We encourage PRs! Add unit tests for your code and run `npm test` before
    opening one, please!

### Testing On Devices

The project has been configured to be an Android and iOS project.  You have 3
options for testing the native app:

1.  `ionic cordova build [ios OR android]` generates necessary files (`.apk` or
    `.app`) to run on a device, but does nothing more.

2.  `ionic cordova emulate [ios OR android]` builds the app, opens an emulator,
    and starts the app for you.

3.  `ionic cordova run [ios OR android]` builds the app and installs it on your
    USB-connected phone (and opens an emulator if no phone is connected). For
    iPhones, this only works on iOS >= 10, and requires special configuration
    (see [ionic's docs](http://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/deploying/)).

## Archived

This project was started years ago to learn about mobile development and JavaScript frameworks, and to provide PVTA's passengers with a mobile app to retrieve realtime information. Since then, PVTA's vendor has released two major revisions, overhauling and significantly improving its realtime mobile app, and PVTAâ€™s information has also started appearing in TransitApp.
